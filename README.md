# Sentiment Analysis Using Logistic Regression

A web-based Sentiment Analysis application built using **Flask** and **Logistic Regression**. This project classifies user opinions into positive or negative sentiments based on a training dataset of tweets.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Programming language used for building the backend.
- **Flask**: Micro web framework for Python, used to build the web application.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library, used for loading and processing data.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit, used for text preprocessing like tokenization and stopword removal.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library, used to build and train the logistic regression model.
- **Logistic Regression**: A machine learning model used to classify sentiments into positive or negative.

## Features
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface where users can input text for sentiment classification.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies user text as either 'positive' or 'negative' sentiment based on a pre-trained logistic regression model.
- **Preprocessing**: Text data is preprocessed by removing special characters and stopwords before being passed to the model for prediction.
